# Manipulating the DOM
## What are the properties that are available for us to modify
* Every element has a set of (1) properties, (2) methods, and (3) events. Some are unique to the element itself, others are inherited from a parent element type. [Anchor `<a>`, as an example](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLAnchorElement)
* [This is a list of all the HTML Element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTML_DOM_API#html_element_interfaces_2). 
* All Elements have properties and methods that are specific to them, as well as more general ones that belong to all of them.
