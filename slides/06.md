# Traversing the DOM
If you move directly from your house to their house, youâ€™re doing the equivalent of traversing the DOMâ€”selecting one element from a neighboring element.

If you lookup their address on Google, youâ€™re doing the equivalent of document.querySelector to find elements.

```html
<div class="neighborhood">
  <div class="your-house">ðŸ˜Ž</div>
  <div class="neighbor-house">ðŸŽ‰</div>
</div>
```

* You can traverse in three directions:
  * Downwards - get child elements
  * Sideways - get siblings of an element
  * Upwards - get parent of an element.
