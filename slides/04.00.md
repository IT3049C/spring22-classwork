# Asynchronous Callbacks and Promises
* HTTP requests are asynchronous functions.
  * We don't know how long they take to finish.
    * Processing time
    * Server speed
    * internet connection speed
    * ... etc.
* We don't want to block the application while asyncronous functions are loading.

## Callbacks
* `onreadystatechange` is a callback. Called everytime, the state is changing.
* Application can process different requests until another change is received.
