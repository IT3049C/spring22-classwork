# Raw React API
## Declarative vs Imperative
- Browser API is an imperative API.
  - statements that changes the program's state.
- React abstracts that with a Declarative API.

**Note:**
* Declarative Programming is like asking your friend to fix your car. You don’t care how to fix it, that’s up to her.

* Imperative Programming is like your friend calling your father that tells them how to fix your car step by step.

## React
* supports different platforms
  * native and web
  * Each platform has platform specific code and shared code

* React has 2 main libraries that we'll use
  * React: to create elements `document.createElement()`
  * ReactDOM: to render the elements `element.append()`

```js
const elementProps = {id: 'element-id', children: 'Hello world!'}
const elementType = 'h1'
const reactElement = React.createElement(elementType, elementProps)
ReactDOM.render(reactElement, rootElement)
```
