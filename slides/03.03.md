# Web API - `sessionStorage`
## Data lifetime - 2
* Does not communicate between tabs. (One session - one tab)
  * A unique page session is created for every tab.
  * Opening the same page on multiple tabs creates a separate session for each.
  * Duplicating a tab copies the tab's sessionStorage into the new tab.
    * No further connection between the tabs.
