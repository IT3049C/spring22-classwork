We now have a test utility that abstracts many of the repetitive testing jobs.

This works fine for syncronous functions

but not for async.

```js
test('sumAsync adds numbers asynchronously', async () => {
  const result = await sumAsync(3, 7)
  const expected = 10
  expect(result).toBe(expected)
})

test('subtractAsync subtracts numbers asynchronously', async () => {
  const result = await subtractAsync(7, 3)
  const expected = 4
  expect(result).toBe(expected)
})
```

right now both will pass, then we get unhandled promise error
with the error coming from the sumAsync

we'll just need to make sure that our library function await the result

```js
async function test(title, callback) {
  try {
    await callback()
    console.log(`✓ ${title}`)
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(`✕ ${title}`)
    console.error(error)
  }
}
```

if I want to use these functions in all my tests I need to export and import them

but we only really did one function of many functions that are built for you through jest.

let's install jest

```
npm install jest
```
move the tests to a file with *.test.js convention
