# Abstracting the Test Assertion
* Create a function that returns an object with some assertions
```js
function expect(actual) {
  return {
    toBe(expected) {
      if (actual !== expected) {
        throw new Error(`${actual} is not equal to ${expected}`)
      }
    }
  }
}
```

You can now use it as 
```js
expect(result).toBe(expected);
```

We can also create 
`toBeGreatedThan`
`toBeLessThan`
