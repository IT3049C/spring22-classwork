## JSON
* JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)

* Lightweight data-interchange/representation format
  * a format to represent, structure, and package data to send and receive between systems.
  * an alternative for XML

* We can use it to configure our applications.
  * Show `package.json`, `.vscode/settings.json` files
  * They Look like JS Objects.

* Key-value pairs
  * The key is a string, and the value can be of any of the JSON supported files
  * Supported Types:
    * Objects
    * Arrays
    * String
    * Number
    * Boolean

  * Unsupported types:
    * Functions or methods
  
* Language-agnostic
  * *inspired by* but not Specific to JS
  * Can be used in other languages with built-in or external libraries that reads and writes the json formats.
  * `JSON.stringify()`, `JSON.parse()`
    * When used in JS will omit unsupported types


* Examples:
  * üê®: Create an Object Literal for the course instructor (name, isInstructor, courses <array of objects>)
    * [JSON file](01.01.json) 
    * [XML file](01.02.xml) 
  * [IT3049C/Students json file](https://github.com/IT3049C/students/blob/master/_data/instructor/Ygilany.json)

* Don't Forget:
  * ü¶â: Keys must be a string. This is JSON not JS.
  * ü¶â: don't forget the commas

* In comparison with XML
  * boolean vs strings
  * arrays vs objects

* We get this data into our front-end applications using HTTP requests
