# Isolate Tests
* If one of the tests fail, the rest don't run.
* We have to look through the error stack to know which test failed. (sub, subtract, ...)
* We need to Encapsulate tests
  * isolte tests from one another
  * all tests will run
  * all test will have a more helpful error message

* Create a test function
